# Database-University_Acceptance
This database is an example of what an University admission process would look like. The database contains information about the students (there are two types: foreign and local), 
about their exam performance and their application submission. In the "db_queries" file I wrote some queries that select from the database information based on certain conditions, and I also wrote down the said conditions. Before testing any queries, run the "Schema" files to create the tables.
